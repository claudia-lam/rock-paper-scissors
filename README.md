# rock-paper-scissors
Rock Paper Scissors Challenge from The Odin Project 

This is my first game and first JS project
What I learned:

*  how to randomly select objects from an array 
*  the importance of arguments and parameters, and how they are passed in a function 
*  targeting nodes and manipulating DOM with JS 
*  creating event listeners
